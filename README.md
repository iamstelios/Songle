Songle is a “location-based mobile phone puzzle game which allows users to follow a map and collect words which have been scattered at random around the University of Edinburgh's Central Area. The words make up the lyrics of a well-known song and the puzzle aspect of the game is to guess the song from the words which have been found”.
