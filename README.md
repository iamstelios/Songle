Songle is a “location-based mobile phone puzzle game which allows users to follow a map and collect words which have been scattered at random around the University of Edinburgh's Central Area. The words make up the lyrics of a well-known song and the puzzle aspect of the game is to guess the song from the words which have been found”. Explore the campus of George Square and physically exercise while playing!
